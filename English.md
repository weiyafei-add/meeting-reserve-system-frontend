Last week I went to the theatre, I had a good seat, the play was very interesting. I did not enjoy it.
A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not here the actors. I turned round. I looked at the young man and the young woman.
// did 表示pay这个动词的过去式
They did not pay any attention. In the end. I could not bear it. I turned round again. "I can't hear a word!" I said angrily.

"It's none of your business". The young man said rudely. "This is a private conversation!".

It was Sunday. I never get up early on Sundays. I sometimes stay in bed until lunch. Last Sunday. I got up very late.
I looked out of my window. It was dark outside. 'What a day!. I thought. 'It's rainning again'. Just then, the telephone rang. It's my aunt Lucy. 'I've just arrived by train', she said. 'I am coming to see you'.
    "But I'm still having breakfast", I said.
    "What are you doing?". she said.
    "I'm having breakfast". I repeated.
    "Dear me" she said. "Do you always get up so late? It's one o'clock".

 I carried my bags into the hall.

 "What are you dong?", my landlady asked.
 "I'm leaving", I said.
 "Why are you leaving? You have been here only a week". She asked.

 "A week is too long, Mrs. Lucy". I said. "There are too many rules in the house, my friends never come to visit me, The dinner always at seven o'clock, so I frequently go to bed hungry. You don't like noise, I rarely listen to the radio. The heating doesn't work, I usually feel very cold. This is terrible place for a man like me. Goodbuy Mrs Lucy"

I have just moved a new house in Bridge Street. Yesterday A begger knocked at my door, the begger asked me for a meal and a glass of beer. In return for this, the begger stood on his head and began sang songs. I gave him the meal and the beer. He ate the meal and drank the beer, then he put a piece of cheese in his pocket and went away. Later a neighborhood told me about the begger. Everyone knows him. His name is Percy Buttons. He called at every house in the street once a mouth and always asks for a meal and a glass of beer.

<!-- The best and The worst -->

Why is Joe's garden the most beautiful one in the town?

Joe Sanders has the most beautiful garden in our town. Nearly everybody enters for "The Nicest Garden Competition" each year. but Jow wins every time. Bill Frith's garden larger than Joe's, Bill works harder than Joe and grows more flowers and vegetales. But Joe's garden is more interesting. He has made neat paths and has built a wooden bridge over a pool. I like gardens too, every year I enter for the garden competition, but I always win a little prize for the worst garden in the town.

I was having a dinner at a restaurant when Tony Steeles came in. Tony worked at a lawyer's office years ago, but he is now working at a bank. He gets a good salary.

<!-- A cold welcome -->

What does 'a cold welcome' refer to?

On Wednesday evening, we went to the Town Hall, It was the last day of the year and a large crowd of people had gathered under the Town Hall clock. It would strike twelve in twenty minutes' time. Fifteen minutes passed and then, at five to twelve, the clock stopped. The big minute hand did not move. We waited and waited, but nothing happened. Suddenly someone shouted. 'It's two minutes past twelve. The clock has stopped'. I looked at my watch. It was true. The big clock refused to welcome the New Year. At the moment, everybody began to laugh and sing.

<!-- Do you speak English?  -->

I had an amusing experience last year. I had left from a small town in south of French and went on to the next town. On the way, a young man waved to me. I stopped and he asked me for a lift. As soon as he had got into the car, I said good morning to him in French. He replied in the same language. Apart from a few words, I do not know any French at all. Neither of us spoke ~~in this~~ during the journey. I had nearly reached the town,~~while he suddenly said~~ when the young man suddenly said, very slowly, 'Do you speak English?'. As I soon learnt, he was English himself.

What was the polite request?

If you park your car in the wrong place, a traffic policeman will soon find it. You will be very lucky if he lets you go without a ticket. However, this does not always happen. Traffic police are sometimes very polite. During a holiday in Sweden, I found this note on my car. 'Sir, we welcome you to our city. This is a "No Parking" area. You will enjoy your stay here if you pay attention to our street signs. This note is only a reminder'. If you receive a request like this, you cannot fail to obey it!

Why is fishing the writer's favourite sport?

Fishing is my favourite sport. I often fish for hours without catching anything.But this does not worry me. Some fishermen are unlucky. Instead of catching fish, they catch old boots and rubbish. I am even less lucky. I never catch anything -- not even old boots. After having spent whole mornings on the river, I always go home with an empty bag. 'You must give up fishing' my friends say. 'It is waste of time'. But they don't realize one important thing. I am not really interested in fishing. I am only interested in sitting in a boat and doingn othing at all!

Aeroplanes are slowly driving me mad. I live near a airport and passing planes can be heard night and day. The airport was built years age, but for some season it could not be used then. Last year it came into use. Over a hundred people must have been driven away from their house by the noise, I am one of a few people left.

Why does the writer not understand the porter?

I arrived in London at last. The railway station was big, black and dark. I did not know the way to my hotel, so I asked a porter. I not only spoke English very carefully, but very clearly as well. The porter, however, could not understand me. I repeated my question several times and at last he understood. He answered me, but he spoke English neither slowly nor clearly. 'I am a foreigner', I said. Then he spoke slowly, but I could not understand him. My English teacher never speak English like that. The porter and I smiled and looked at each other. Then he said something and I understood it. 'You will soon learn English', he said. I wonder. In England, each person speaks a different language. The English understand each other, but I don't understand them! Do they speak English?
